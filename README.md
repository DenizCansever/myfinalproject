# uClub (Web Application for Students Clubs in Universities)
## Description
In this project, there is a android application for my student theses.
Android application designed for students and clubs in the beginning.
In the Database Web Site section, administrators can control system and to view via firebase panel.
## Aim of the Project
The purpose of this project is to allow student clubs to make themselves known, plan activities and display their event schedules.
Also, clubs will be able to share visual material from their previous activities, and a web platform will be created for all students to gather insight about clubs and their activities.
I wanted to develop a User Interface system that is more efficient and more integrated.
This project is designed available to use in many university campuses.
As a demo I used our university as a point of use.
## Completed Work
The methods of use in our university, three real Club’s owners make their special pages.
The visitors of the school to see what clubs in university have page in active on app, what events they made and information about next events as time, space and explaining.
Teachers makes event schedule too in the future work.
Users can make their profiles as info, photo, major and contact information.
They can see the popular clubs and coming event on the main page.
They can search for the specific clubs.
Provided connection to clubs' social medias in clubs' pages.
An application developed for Bilgi University would be mobile friendly and thus Android users will have the chance to use it.
